                 <li>For making chena, add 1-liter full cream milk to the pan, and let it come to a boil.</li>
                 <li>Once the milk starts boiling, turn the heat to low and start adding the acidic agent (lemon juice, vinegar, citric acid) little by little.</li>
                 <li>Keep stirring until the milk is curdled and the whey (light green water) is separated from the milk completely. Turn off the heat.</li>
                 <li>Now place a muslin cloth or a cotton cloth over a colander.</li> 
                 <li>To drain, pour the coagulated milk over the cloth and rinse well with the ice-cold water to discard the whey.</li>
                 <li>Gather up the cloth from all the sides.</li>
                 <li>Squeeze it well to take out the excess water. Hang it on tap for about 30 minutes.</li>
                 <li>After 30 minutes, remvoe chena from the cloth. Chena is now ready for use. Keep it aside.</li>
